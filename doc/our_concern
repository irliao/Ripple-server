our concern:
user info, message content, bot

How should we authenenticate device?
we currentily use one main token to authenticatie user and grant temporary token for comunucation in each session
How should we encript server to device comunucation?
We decide to use SSL, HTTPS. Should we also encrypt application wise.

Are there any secruity concern with formdata
